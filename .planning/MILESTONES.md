- SEM-style 12dB state-variable filter with trapezoidal integration and soft saturation
- Four simultaneous filter outputs (LP, HP, BP, Notch) with Cytomic-derived formulas
- 16-voice polyphony with independent filter state per voice
- Comprehensive CV control for cutoff, resonance, and drive with attenuverters
- Blended saturation algorithm with output-specific drive scaling for Oberheim character

**Stats:**
- 40 files created/modified
- 322 lines of C++ (core module code)
- 7 phases, 7 plans
- 5 days from start to ship

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `feat(07-01)`
